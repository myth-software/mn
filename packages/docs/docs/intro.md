# documenation

let's discover **mount notion in less than 5 minutes**

## getting started

get started by **installing**

```sh
npm i --save-dev @mountnotion/{cli,types,schematics,sdk,utils}
```

or **try mount notion immediately** with **[sandbox](https://sandbox.mountnotion.com)**.

### what you'll need

- [nx monorepo](https://nx.dev//) version 16 or above
- [notion account](https://affiliate.notion.so/xysfb04gkht8) (affiliate link)

## setup a new page

generate a new mountnotion page using the **starter template**

the starter template will automatically be added to your notion workspace after you copy it

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
